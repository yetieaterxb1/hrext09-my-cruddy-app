Create Read Update and Delete framework using JS
## The Idea
    A beer tracking app. With the growth of the craft beer industry its impossible to keep track. This will allow you to store personal ranking and notes about each beer you try. This will also make a combined personal rating for the brewery that brewed that beer. 
## User Story
    Bob walks into the liquor store and sees a wall of beers. He has been to many breweries in the past and has tried many beers. He knows exactly what he is looking for, a fruity IPA, the only problem is he cant remember which beers tasted that way. Thank goodness Bob downloaded the Beer Flight app and has a record of beers he has tried. Instead of staring aimlessly at the wall he quickly picks out a 6-pack from a local brewery he visited months ago with friends. 

    Bob puts his 6-pack in the fridge and gets a call from is friend Kevin. Kevin wants to go to a brewery and enjoy the nice weather. Kevin suggests a few breweries to Bob and tells him to pick. Bob looks at his Beer Flight app and sees that his personal rating on one of the breweries is high. The rating is high because it had a lager and a IPA that Bob previously rated highly. Bob and Kevin both enjoy beers in the sun.

    Bob then sees a new beer he would like to try at the brewery. Bob orders it, tastes it, and records his rating as well as a comment about the stout being a bit too bitter. Bob now will remember that when looking for a stout at the liquor store. 

    Bob is now happy and stress free thanks to Beer Flight.
